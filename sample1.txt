==History==
{{Main|History of Northwestern University}}

The foundation of Northwestern University is traceable to a meeting on May 31, 1850 of nine prominent Chicago businessmen, Methodist leaders and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had once been known as the [[Northwest Territory]]. On January 28, 1851, the [[Illinois General Assembly]] granted a charter to the ''Trustees of the North-Western University'', making it the first chartered university in Illinois.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williamson|Wild|1976|pp=5–6}}</ref><ref name="Charter">{{cite web |title=The Northwestern University Charter and Amendments |url=http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/nu_charter.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=August 5, 2007 |publisher=Northwestern University}}</ref> The school's nine founders, all of whom were Methodists (three of them [[Elder (Methodism)|ministers]]), knelt in [[Prayer in Christianity|prayer]] and [[Christian worship|worship]] before launching their first organizational meeting.<ref name="Northwestern">{{cite web |url=http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/northwestern/summer2002/features/coverstory/index.htm |title=Keeping the Faith |publisher=Northwestern |quote=Northwestern's own religious identity stretches back to its genesis. The University began with a prayer — the school's nine founders (all of them Methodists, three of them ministers) knelt in worship before launching their first organizational meeting. During that meeting, they agreed to establish a university under the patronage of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Through most of its history, Northwestern kept a strong Methodist tie. Regional church conferences chose a member of the board of trustees, and until 1890 every University president was an ordained Methodist minister. |accessdate = 2007-07-20}}</ref> Although they affiliated the university with the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], they were committed to [[non-sectarian]] admissions, believing that Northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory.<ref name="Planning a university">{{cite web|url=http://www.nu150.northwestern.edu/news/stories/10_21_00_founders.html |title=Planning a university to serve the Northwest Territory|quote=Although the founders were strong Methodists — three of them were Methodist ministers and before the meeting all those in attendance joined in prayer — they also firmly believed that Northwestern should be institution that would serve all people.

John Evans, for whom Evanston is named, bought {{convert|379|acre|ha}} of land along Lake Michigan in 1853, and Philo Judson developed plans for what would become the city of [[Evanston, Illinois]]. The first building, [[Old College, Northwestern University|Old College]], opened on November 5, 1855.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williamson|Wild|1976|pp=10–11}}</ref> To raise funds for its construction, Northwestern sold $100 "perpetual scholarships" entitling the purchaser and his heirs to free tuition.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williamson|Wild|1976|pp=6}}</ref><ref name="Perpetual scholarships">{{cite web|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/features/historic_moments/11_5_00_scholarship.html |title=Perpetual Scholarships provided early university funding |accessdate=August 5, 2007 |publisher=Northwestern University |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20070803194448/http://www.northwestern.edu/features/historic_moments/11_5_00_scholarship.html |archivedate =August 3, 2007}}</ref> Another building, [[University Hall (Northwestern University)|University Hall]], was built in 1869 of the same Joliet limestone as the [[Chicago Water Tower]], also built in 1869, one of the few buildings in the heart of Chicago to survive the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.www.dailynorthwestern.com/media/storage/paper853/news/2002/10/28/Campus/Eclectic.By.Design-1902783.shtml |title=Eclectic by Design |publisher=''[[The Daily Northwestern]]''|date=October 28, 2002}}</ref> In 1873 the [[Evanston College for Ladies]] merged with Northwestern, and [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]], who later gained fame as a [[Women's suffrage|suffragette]] and as one of the founders of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), became the school's first [[dean of women]]. [[Willard Residential College]] (1938) is named in her honor. Northwestern admitted its first women students in 1869, and the first woman was graduated in 1874.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williamson|Wild|1976|pp=23–28}}</ref>

Northwestern fielded its first intercollegiate football team in 1882, later becoming a founding member of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. In the 1870s and 1880s, Northwestern affiliated itself with already existing schools of law, medicine, and dentistry in Chicago. [[Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law]] is the oldest law school in Chicago. As the university increased in wealth and distinction, and enrollments grew, these professional schools were integrated with the undergraduate college in Evanston; the result was a modern research university combining professional, graduate, and undergraduate programs, which gave equal weight to teaching and research.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williamson|Wild|1976|pp=83–84,110}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Northwestern Undergraduate Catalog 2005–07 |volume=XXVIII, |edition=3 |year=2005}}</ref> The [[Association of American Universities]] invited Northwestern to become a member in 1917. [[File:Deering front.jpg|thumb|left|Deering Library (1933)]]
Under [[Walter Dill Scott]]'s presidency from 1920 to 1939, Northwestern began construction of an integrated campus in Chicago designed by [[James Gamble Rogers]] to house the professional schools; established the [[Kellogg School of Management]]; and built several prominent buildings on the Evanston campus, [[Dyche Stadium]] (now named Ryan Field) and [[Deering Library]] among others. In 1933, a proposal to merge Northwestern with the [[University of Chicago]] was considered but rejected.<ref name="Barnes">{{cite journal|last=Barnes |first=Sarah |title=A Lost Opportunity in American Education?

Northwestern played host to the first-ever [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] game in 1939 in the original [[Patten Gymnasium]], which was later demolished and relocated farther north along with the [[Dearborn Observatory]] to make room for the [[Northwestern Technological Institute|Technological Institute]].

After the golden years of the 1920s, the [[Great Depression in the United States]] (1929-1941) hit Northwestern hard. Its annual income dropped 25 percent from $4.8 million in 1930-31 to $3.6 million in 1933-34. Investment income shrank, fewer parents could pay full tuition, and annual giving from  alumni and philanthropy fell from $870,000 in 1932 to a low of  $331,000 in 1935. The university responded with two salary cuts of 10 percent each for all employees. It imposed a hiring freeze, a building freeze, and slashed appropriations for maintenance, books, and research. Having had a balanced budget in 1930-31, the University now faced deficits of roughly $100,000 for the next four years, which was made up by using the endowment. Enrollments fell in most schools, with law and music suffering the biggest declines. But the movement toward state certification of school teachers prompted Northwestern to start a new graduate program in education, thereby bringing in new students and much needed income. In June 1933, President [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] of the University of Chicago proposed a merger of the two universities, estimating annual savings of $1.7 million. The two presidents were enthusiastic, the faculty liked the idea; the Northwestern alumni, however, were vehemently opposed to it, fearing the loss of their Alma Mater and its many traditions that distinguished Northwestern from Chicago. The medical school, for example, was oriented toward training practitioners, and feared it would lose its mission if it were merged into the larger, research-oriented University of Chicago medical school.  The merger plan was dropped.  The [[Charles Deering|Deering]] family gave an unrestricted gift of $6 million in 1935 that rescued the budget, bringing it up to $5.4 million in 1938-39. That allowed many of the spending cuts to be restored, including  half the salary reductions. <ref> Harold F. Williamson and Payson S.
